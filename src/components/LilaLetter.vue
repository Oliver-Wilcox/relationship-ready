			<br />
			<br />
			If you found us because a friend recommended us or because you have
			stumbled across us, welcome. Before you continue… what you will not
			find here is tips on how to flirt or how to find your ideal partner.
			We don’t think you need to know how to flirt, you will see that when
			you are just you. As far as finding the perfect partner- most of our
			clients say they would not have picked their current partner yet
			they are happier than they have ever been in a relationship - the
			imagination is just too limited when it comes to finding a good fit
			or understanding what happiness really means.<br /><br />
			I founded Relationship Ready for two reasons. The first: 15 years
			in, my relationship had slipped into patterns of upset and distance.
			We tried to communicate and connect, we just weren’t hearing each
			other - ! When I looked towards myself, I felt different- without a
			change in him. With a fresh set of eyes I realised I had a choice,
			and in that moment, I chose him all over again. The Second: I kept
			seeing a pattern in my business clients, they were passionate and
			highly capable but struggled with love. As I got to know them, I
			could see that they were holding softer parts of themselves back, in
			an attempt to not feel disappointed or hurt again. Every area in
			their lives was flourishing, all except love, and I knew their
			thoughts had to be getting in the way – read that again… it really
			is that simple! I am in love with helping people find and feel love.
			I have worked with people who have a partner but are lonelier in
			their relationship than out. I have worked with people who have not
			known how to just be themselves in a relationship. I have helped
			people dissolve the old thought stories that have played out the
			same relationship patterns in their lives for years. Sometimes I
			work with people who don’t know what they want…but they are ready
			for something new...we can help find it.<br /><br />
			I look forward to meeting you and hearing your story. Please get in
			touch, we would love to find out if we can help you.<br /><br />Love
			Lila x
