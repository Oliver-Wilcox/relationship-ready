			I grew up in a small town in Concordia, Missouri. It was idyllic
			living there but I was eager to get out and explore the world. In
			some ways I am a small-town girl and enjoyed the feeling of
			community, but I always knew I wanted to explore the world outside
			of what I knew. I have always been driven and ambitious to be
			successful. My first business was Retail Profile in London, bringing
			pop up retail to shopping centres. I learnt so much. I was a naive
			entrepreneur and everything was a learning experience for me. I am
			proud of the people we hired and trained, as we gave them the
			opportunity to grow and go on to do new and great things. I now run
			my own business called Bold Clarity, where I work with
			entrepreneurs. I love it as I am able to work with ambitious
			leaders, who want to have an impact in what they create. Growing up
			I was always the consummate single girl. In my teens, I was late to
			have a boyfriend and in my twenties I focused on my studies and my
			career. I always thought I'd figure out romance and relationships
			later. I would meet people but was not focussed on having a
			relationship. I fell in love with my first boyfriend when I was
			twenty-five. We had a wonderful relationship over three years, but I
			didn't see my future with him. I couldn't picture myself in a
			wedding dress or getting married. I knew my life was going to take a
			different direction. When an opportunity for a career move came up,
			I decided to take it and move away leaving the relationship.

			That was the longest relationship I had, right up to my forties.
			Over time, romantic relationships became a point of contention for
			me. I started to struggle with dating and the pressure I put myself
			under, about the whole experience.. The more successful I got in my
			professional life, the more expectations I built up, about what my
			date should be like, what a relationship should look like, and how
			it should happen. I always over-analysed. I tried to ‘figure out’
			whether I should go out with this guy again, rather than look to see
			how I ‘felt’ about it. Dating wasn't very natural, or very easy for
			me. Friends and people I met would say to me ‘Oh, you're so
			outgoing, so easy to talk to, I can't believe you're not in a
			relationship.’ Then they would give me a lot of advice, like: ‘You
			should always give a guy three dates.’ ‘Give people a chance.’ ‘You
			need to put yourself out there.’ ‘Your standards are too high.’ At
			the same time I would get advice like ‘You need to play hard to
			get.’ ‘Don’t make a quick decision.’ I would have short
			relationships here and there, but nothing stuck. I would force
			relationships because he matched my tick box list of what I assumed
			I wanted. I would try to make it work, even though I knew it wasn't
			right. It was the thing in my life that I couldn't figure out. I had
			a great business that I started and ran for fourteen years. I
			progressed. I grew my leadership skills. I had great friendships
			around me. I had great family relationships. There was just one
			blind spot, which was my romantic life. It was a real struggle and a
			challenge for me, for decades. The big question I wanted an answer
			for was; ‘When is it going to be my turn?’ Four years ago I booked
			myself on to the Relationships Ready program. I went into the
			program to see what I could learn. I had tried so many things and
			thought, it couldn’t hurt. What was one more thing to try? I felt
			very welcome when I joined the course. I had things in common with
			other people who had also struggled in this area of their life. They
			struck me as an amazing, successful, kind, and interesting group of
			women. There was a camaraderie, a combination of listening and
			learning, sharing our stories from the heart, and we were able to
			learn from each other.
			<br />
			<br />
			When I came in, I was looking for a solution, like there was
			something wrong with me. I wanted to know what I was doing wrong, or
			what process I should have followed, or what philosophy I’d missed
			that made me not successful at dating. Working with Lila helped me
			see how I showed up in my romantic life. I talked about real life
			situations in my coaching sessions, like when I’d met somebody, or I
			had an interaction and I was able to get clarity and support on what
			had not been visible to me before. I saw how my expectations had
			gotten in the way of my ability to connect with people. I saw how
			much I had on my mind, when I went on a date, and how unpleasant and
			restrictive that was. I saw how my tick list was not helping me to
			be present on a date. I was able to drop all that thinking, all my
			requirements and relax. I learned the difference between when my
			head was calm, what I like to call my true self, versus when I was
			on a march of ‘what should I do next’. From there it was easy for me
			to see the difference between how I showed up, and how that might
			come across to others. I used to get feedback like: ‘you’re really
			driven’ or ‘you’re hard to handle’ When I saw what was happening in
			my own head, it started to make sense why things hadn’t clicked for
			me. This gave me permission to be a little softer, a little less
			expectant and a little more in the moment, so I could see and feel
			what was right for me, not just ‘think’ what was right for me. Soon
			after the program, I met a guy. My old self would have jumped to
			‘not right for me’. I had a laundry list of things that, in my old
			mindset, would mean he was wrong for me. At the top of the list was
			the fact that he was going through a divorce. I had made up thoughts
			about guys who were going through the process: they were a bad idea
			and I didn’t want to get involved with that. I was drawn to him but
			not sure about romance. I took it slow and because I was not
			rushing, I was able to say ‘Let's just be friends.’ I let go of my
			knee jerk reactions and was open. That would not have been the case
			before. What I learned gave me a different way to approach getting
			to know him. I took my time, and followed only what felt right for
			me. I didn't make up things about him or where it should go in my
			head. The result was we became friends and during that time I got to
			know him at a vulnerable stage in his life. I got to see how he
			solved problems, how he tried to do things for the greater good of
			the relationship with his ex-wife and his children. I got to see who
			he was without my usual expectations and assumptions. I took things
			slow and, with trust in myself, I was able to build an honest and
			open friendship with him that naturally developed into a romantic
			relationship. Four years on, we are still together, still learning
			and growing and it's better than ever. We are now engaged. It’s a
			miracle. I spent decades being single, wanting a relationship but
			not knowing how to navigate myself into finding one. This outcome
			was pretty miraculous, and unexpected. As a business person I look
			at the return on investment, what I get for the money and time
			invested. Absolutely hands down, this program was worth it. I
			learned to be myself and building on, what I like to call, quiet
			confidence and a level of neutrality, has allowed me to find dating
			easier. I used to think neutral was a bad word, but now I think it's
			a good word, because from that balanced place, I can go anywhere, as
			opposed to starting with a set position. It has been a wonderful
			learning experience. I am so glad I did this program. I used to put
			a lot of pressure on myself to always do better and to do more. I
			now have this lovely gift that gave me an exponential return in
			confidence, a new level of satisfaction and a knowing what to look
			for, my own clarity in dating and the ability to make a decision
			that I feel confident in, without double guessing myself. And that
			is so liberating.
