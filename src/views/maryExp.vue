			My first job was as a secretary for an estate agent in Lancashire.
			I’ve always been ambitious and wanted to be my own boss. I learn by
			doing and I’m tenacious and determined. I had dyslexia and couldn’t
			type, but I think my boss kept me on, because he liked my spirit. I
			ended up being promoted to manager, rare for a woman back then. I
			think it was because I loved problem solving and was willing to
			throw myself in and do jobs at weekends that other people didn’t
			want to do. I spent most of my forty year career in property
			development and investment in Edinburgh. I learned the ropes by eye
			and diligence. I joined a male dominated industry but had fallen in
			love with the work, so I didn't leave. My motto is ‘proceed until
			apprehended’. Once in a meeting, it was assumed I was there to make
			the tea, not broker a property deal. I had to deal with this kind of
			thing all the time. My passion for the work allowed me to keep
			going, regardless of how women were perceived at the time. Now I
			work full time as a coach and mentor. I support entrepreneurs
			through my work on the board of Entrepreneurial Scotland. I love to
			see projects and people grow and become the best they can be. When I
			joined the Relationship Ready program, I had been married for 25
			years and single for twelve. My kids were nearly grown up and I knew
			I was going to become an empty nester. I thought it might be nice to
			date. It might be cool to share my life with someone. Although I had
			dated since my divorce, none of the relationships had felt right or
			gone anywhere meaningful. I thought it was time to try something
			new. Even though I felt apprehensive, I knew Lila and knew it would
			be a safe space, so I joined anyway. I thought that, at the least, I
			might learn something about myself or maybe how to talk to my
			clients about relationships and, at best, I would get to spend time
			with Lila, which is always a joy. All those things happened and,
			funnily enough, what I learned about myself was the biggest thing! I
			came to the program with a lot of assumptions, about what I thought
			made someone datatable. I thought I was undatable. I had the idea
			that an enjoyable relationship probably wasn't gonna happen for me.
			I had been mostly single since my divroce. I thought that, when
			you're a woman knocking on sixty, you have to date someone in their
			seventies. I thought men didn’t like women who hold down a
			successful career. I thought because I wasn’t a size ten, men
			wouldn’t want me. So I had lots of thinking around why it wasn't
			going to work out for me.
		</p>

		<p class="experience-2" ref="expTwo">
			On day one of the program, I was curious to see what we would talk
			about. I soon realized that dating was a tough subject for me. It
			was refreshing to hear everybody's stories and know that I wasn’t on
			my own. Working with Lila was great because there was no judgement
			about the crazy things I told myself, or thought about myself. I
			felt heard, listened to, appreciated. I learned so much from the get
			go. I really liked the one to one sessions.It was nice to have the
			opportunity to talk about things I was seeing and feeling. We talked
			about living in love and happiness every day. I realized, ‘oh my
			God, I've lived the opposite of that’. I'd literally done the
			opposite. I had held on to resentment. I had lived in judgment. I
			had not seen that I could choose how I felt in a relationship. I
			loved seeing that because it gave me a chance not to do it anymore.
			That was a really big game changer for me. When I mentioned that
			being a successful business person would be off putting to men. Lila
			said , “Well, if you showed up in work mode to every interaction of
			your day, that might be quite hard, but you know, sometimes you're
			goofy and sometimes you're funny and sometimes you don't know the
			right from your left.” She said all these things about me and I was
			like, ‘oh yeah, she's right’, my professional side is a tiny part of
			who I am, but I'd put it in as a massive blocker. This was a huge
			insight. Another impactful conversation was about goodwill in a
			relationship and how helpful and how loving that is. The idea that
			the goodwill that exists between, say, you and your child, could be
			taken into your relationship really struck a chord with me. I
			thought ‘Oh okay. Okay.’ Seeing that unconditional power was another
			game changer. The results of the program were immediate. I felt
			happier about myself and I felt dateable. I am now in a relationship
			where I feel like I can be myself. We started dating soon after the
			program. I don’t think I would have noticed that he was interested
			in me, if I hadn’t done the course. We had met many years ago and
			then hadn't seen each other for thirty years. We reconnected in a
			business context. Being myself while dating, let the whole process
			(of stepping into a relationship) unfold naturally. There was no
			double guessing or mental work involved. We’ve been together for
			four years now and I honestly didn’t know this kind of happiness was
			available to me. I know it sounds like a cliche but, when you can
			really be yourself, it's an amazing feeling. I don’t have to watch
			my P's and Q's. Anybody who knows me, knows I am not a pushover, but
			I’ve seen that when you are kind, giving and caring, it comes back
			to you. It's a lovely place to live. Sometimes we agree, and
			sometimes we don't. We're very straightforward with each other. I'm
			definite about what feels right to me. I live my life from a place
			of intuitive creativeness, the sort of wisdom that comes through me.
			Sometimes I hold back and sometimes I don't. Sometimes I'll say I'm
			not comfortable with that, and sometimes it doesn't really matter.
			I'm different in this relationship. I feel more relaxed. I am more
			of myself than I ever have been before. I feel a whole lot happier.
			I don't have a lot of second guessing.
			<br />
			<br />
			It was a massive surprise, how this relationship appeared in my
			life. One reason it appeared, was because I was more open to it, for
			sure. and then I was more nurturing of the relationship, once I was
			in it. I became more mindful of how I am in it. Before I could get
			quite grumpy or judgmental, annoyed or frustrated about my partner,
			and I'm not saying I don't do that now, but now I let things go
			more, rather than jump onto my reactions. I don't get worked up
			about it at all. And that feels different. I'm easier to be with and
			because of that we have an easier relationship. Because I show up
			like that, I think maybe he does too. Four years in and it's
			fantastic. We have a really lovely relationship. It's been, unlike
			any other relationship I've ever had in my life. He's younger than
			me, I'm still not a size ten and I'm not sure I ever will be. I can
			still rock it in the business world. All of those things are still
			in play, but for some reason, it's all good.
